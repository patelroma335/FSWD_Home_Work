## ClassNotes

Functions in Javascript are object

var -> accesible in the function
let -> accesible in the block
const -> accesible in the block

## Iterative Flow

for statement
A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The Javascript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop.
for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
statement

while statement
A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates true.
while (condition)
statement

do...while statement
The do...while statement repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.
do
statement
while (condition);

for...in statement
The for...in statement iterates a specified variable over all the enumerable properties of an object. For each distinct property, Javascript executes the specified statements.
for (variable in object)
statement

for...of statement
The for...of statement creates a loop Iterating over iterable objects(including Array, Map, Set, arguments object and so on), invoking a custom iteration hook with statements to be executed for the value of each distinct property.
for (variable of object)
statement
